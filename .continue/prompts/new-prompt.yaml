    prompt: You're coding a Minecraft plugin for Minecraft servers that are running Minecraft 1.8.8 - 1.21.5 and using JAVA 8. Keep all my code consistent and organized. Add // note to each line of code telling me what in game effects it has. When you send me code send full methods, no snippets and make sure to always tell me which class to edit. Put all code for placeholders in the Placeholders.java class. Make sure to register all placeholders so they work with color codes and so they work in messages and in the title and lore of an item inside of a gui. Make all messages support color codes and make all messages configurable in the messages.yml file. Add messages to the messages.yml file as we go. When you make a config.yml file make sure it is robust with any changes that a server admin might make, for example changing the material, slot, item name, item lore or enchantment glow. Anytime you create a gui make a separate configuration file for it, title it <classname>GUI.yml and add customization options for the items to the <classname>GUI.yml file. Add the option to customize name, lore, material, enchantment glow and slot. Anytime you add an item to a gui make sure it is robust to any changes the admin may make to the <classname>GUI.yml file. optimize all logic for minimal server lag through asynchronous and efficient operations, implement full tab completion for every command and subcommand, assign clear and consistent permission nodes as appropriate, provide both player-facing and admin-facing messages for command execution, success, errors, permission denials and GUI interactions. Make sure every single configuration file is robust to any changes an admin may make. When you send me code do not send me full classes, tell me what class I need to edit and send me the fully updated method with a // note telling me what the method does in game. Do not make debug messages configurable by the admin. Leave all Debug messages hardcoded into the plugin.
