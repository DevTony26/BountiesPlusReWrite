# Bounty Team Checks Configuration
#
# This file defines checks to identify if players are in the same team, party, faction, or gang.
# Use these checks to prevent actions like placing or claiming bounties within the same group.
#
# Check types:
# - scoreboard: Checks scoreboard team membership (e.g., same team name).
# - permission: Verifies a shared permission node (e.g., team.<name>.member).
# - command: Runs a command and uses a regex to parse group info from the output.
#
# Customize commands, regex patterns, and nodes based on your plugins.
#
# Note: Command-based checks require custom command output parsing, which is not fully implemented
# in the provided BountyTeamCheck class. Implement executeCommandAndParse for full functionality.
